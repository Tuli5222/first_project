    <p>National flag consisting of a dark bluish green field (background) incorporating a large, off-centre orange-red disk. The flagâ€™s width-to-length ratio is 3 to 5.From its founding in 1949, the Awami League was the expression of Bengali nationalism in the territory then known as East Pakistan. Following elections in December 1970, which the league won, the military ruler of Pakistan canceled the National Assembly. Opposition to this by the Awami League led to the creation of a national flag for the Bengali homeland, Bangladesh. The flag of Bangladesh, like that of Pakistan, is dark green. This is a symbol of the Islamic faith of most of the population. Bengalis officially have a secular state, however, and therefore have defined the green as a symbol of the rich vegetation of their country and of the hope placed in their youth.
